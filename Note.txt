1. The noteworthy about voxel_size and volume_size
   in the point2volume process:
   ->1<- the voxel_size of two point clouds should be same,
         in this way, the same structure in two point clouds 
         is the same output in two volumes.
   ->2<- because the voxel_size is identical and the ranges
         of two point clouds are different, the sizes of two
         volumes are different
   ->3<- because the volume sizes are different,
         the sizes of Fourier Transform are different.
   ->4<- BUT: to make sure the SEI patch of the same size 
         correspond to the same range of structure in point clouds,
         the size of Fourier Transform input to computation SEI
         should be the same. If the sizes of input Fourier Transform are
         different, then the SEI would compact some frequencies components. 
   Conclusion: the volumes of two point clouds should be converted into the same size.
