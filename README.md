# TAMS_SEI_registration3.0

This package is collrection of C/C++ routines which align 3D scans based
on Spherical Entropy Image(SEI) and Spherical Harmonics(SH).

This version is the only version without theoretical defect,
but is the most complicate one. Version3.0 computes SEI 
based on the magnitude of FFT of the original point cloud.

However, Version2.0 is recommended.
